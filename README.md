This is the repository for my course, [Web Project Workflows with Gulp.js, Git, and Browserify](http://www.lynda.com/AngularJS-tutorials/Building-Data-Driven-App-AngularJS/174237-2.html). The full course is available at [lynda.com](http://lynda.com).

## Course Description
Modern front-end development means more than just writing HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Developing an efficient workflow will help you write better code and test and deploy your web applications easily and efficiently. Staff author Ray Villalobos is here to show you how to generate a workflow that makes it easier to build websites with processed languages like Sass, Compass, and CoffeeScript. He'll show how to automate development and production versions of your sites, track and share project files with Git and GitHub, and add libraries like jQuery and Mustache.js with Browserify. All of these techniques should easily translate to building your own web projects.

## Topics include:
- Why workflow management?
- Processing tasks with gulp-coffee
- Importing libraries with Browserify
- Processing Sass and Compass
- Issuing tasks in sequence
- Watching changes to files
- Adding static reloads
- Setting up environment variables
- Minifying HTML
- Compressing images
